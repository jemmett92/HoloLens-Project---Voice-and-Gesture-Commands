# HoloLensProject
Hololens Project built using Visual Studio 2015 and Unity, uses Voice Commands and Gestures.
It basically projects a screen on wherever your looking that has a table with blocks on it.
The aim is to knock the blocks off the table with a ball.

# Voice Commands and Gesture Controls
Saying shoot will shoot a ball, saying reset blocks will reset the blocks.
Doing a pinch or snap gesture will shoot the ball also and then expanding your hand from a closed fist will reset the blocks.
